<h1>Privacy Policy for OneLogs</h1>
<p class="date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 26-12-2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
OneLogs (“the app”) is a personal diary and logging application designed to help users
record daily thoughts, tasks, and personal notes on their Android devices.
Your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy explains how OneLogs handles user data
and aligns with Google Play’s User Data and Transparency policies.
</p>

<h2>2. App Audience</h2>
<p>
OneLogs is intended for general audiences.
It is not specifically directed at children and does not knowingly collect personal
information from children beyond what is required for normal app usage.
</p>

<h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>

<h3>3.1 User-Provided Content</h3>
<p>
OneLogs collects and stores only the information you voluntarily enter into the app,
such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Diary entries and notes</li>
    <li>Titles, tags, timestamps</li>
    <li>Tasks or logs you create</li>
</ul>
<p>
This content is referred to as <strong>user content</strong>.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Device and Technical Information</h3>
<p>
The app may process limited technical information required for core functionality and
stability, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device model</li>
    <li>Android version</li>
    <li>App crash or error logs</li>
</ul>
<p>
This data is typically handled by the Android operating system and is not collected or
stored by the developer in a personally identifiable manner.
</p>

<h3>3.3 No Account or Direct Identifiers</h3>
<p>
OneLogs does not require:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Account creation</li>
    <li>Name, email address, or phone number</li>
    <li>Any online profile or login</li>
</ul>
<p>
All core features work offline.
</p>

<h2>4. How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
<p>
By default, all user content is stored locally on your device in the app’s private
storage or local database.
Other apps cannot access this data without system-level permissions or rooting.
If you enable Android system backups (such as Google Drive backup), app data may be
included according to your device and Google account settings.
</p>

<h2>5. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
<p>
Your data is used only to provide core functionality, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creating and editing entries</li>
    <li>Searching, filtering, and organizing logs</li>
    <li>Generating local statistics or reminders</li>
    <li>Exporting your data when you choose</li>
</ul>
<p>
All processing happens locally on your device unless you explicitly export or share data.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
<p>
OneLogs does not sell, rent, or share your personal data or diary content with third parties.
The app does not include advertising SDKs that read or analyze your content.
The developer does not receive your diary entries or exported files.
</p>
<p>
If you export or share data (for example, to email, cloud storage, or another app),
the destination service will handle that data under its own privacy policy.
</p>

<h2>7. Export and Deletion</h2>

<h3>7.1 Export</h3>
<p>
OneLogs allows you to export your data in structured formats (such as text, CSV, or JSON)
for backup or transfer purposes.
You are responsible for securing any exported files.
</p>

<h3>7.2 Deletion</h3>
<p>
You can delete individual entries or clear app data using in-app options where available.
Uninstalling the app generally removes locally stored data from private app storage.
Exported or shared copies stored elsewhere are not automatically deleted.
</p>

<h2>8. Permissions</h2>
<p>
OneLogs requests only the minimum permissions necessary for its functionality.
Each permission request includes a clear, in-app explanation.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Camera</strong> – Used for capturing and storing images for image-based logging</li>
    <li><strong>Gallery / Image access</strong> – Used to allow users to select images for image-based logging</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sensitive permissions such as microphone, location, contacts, or SMS are not required
unless explicitly introduced and explained in a future update.
</p>

<h2>9. Security</h2>
<p>
OneLogs relies on Android’s built-in security features, including app sandboxing and
private storage isolation.
While reasonable measures are used to protect your data, no system can guarantee
absolute security. Users are encouraged to use device-level protections such as screen
locks, encryption, and secure backups.
</p>

<h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
Currently, OneLogs does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or cloud
services that access user content.
If such services are added in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated to clearly
describe the data involved, how it is used, and which third parties are involved.
All integrations will comply with Google Play policies.
</p>

<h2>11. AI-Assisted Policy Disclosure</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy was drafted with assistance from AI tools based on developer-provided
information and Google Play policy guidance.
The developer of OneLogs remains fully responsible for the app’s behavior and data
handling practices.
</p>

<h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect app feature changes or legal and platform
requirement updates.
When significant changes occur, the updated policy will be made available through the
Google Play listing and/or within the app.
</p>

<h2>13. Contact</h2>
<p>
For privacy-related questions or requests, contact the developer using the contact
information provided on the Google Play store listing.
Requests related to access, correction, or deletion of data will be handled where
technically feasible and in accordance with applicable laws.
